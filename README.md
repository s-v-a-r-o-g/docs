Svarog enables users to easily generate and issue tokens of any standard without involving any type of a central authority, such as a government or a bank. The tokens can either be non-fungible or they can be crypto coins.&#x20;

Aside from minting new tokens, the platform also provides a universal mechanism for making claims, which means that crypto startups are able to distribute their own tokens within the Solana community while users can get minted tokens in just a few clicks.

Generally speaking, Svarog allows newbie projects to focus their resources on marketing activities and building strong bonds with their audience without having to worry about development-related activities.&#x20;
