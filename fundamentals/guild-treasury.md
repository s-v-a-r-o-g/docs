### About Svarog <a href="#docs-internal-guid-91bf92ab-7fff-605b-ec9f-244b3d3b14b1" id="docs-internal-guid-91bf92ab-7fff-605b-ec9f-244b3d3b14b1"></a>

Svarog is a crypto incubator and offers a set of tools for launching projects on Solana. The platform is based on the DAO philosophy, whereby the DAO manages the protocol and provides the infrastructure for the incubated projects. Incubated projects, along with the first users and the help of Svarog’s startup tools, can gain liquidity through the Guild Treasury.&#x20;

### Treasury

The Treasury is formed by transferring funds from the users to the DAO through bond redemption on SVRG-USDC (or any other stablecoin set by the DAO), where SVRG can be purchased at a 10% discount on the market rate. The market rate is taken as an average of the last 4 hours (TWAP).

The SVRG tokens that users buy are received for 4 days and each block in the blockchain unfreezes some of the tokens.&#x20;

For example, if a user buys 1,000 tokens, 0.00289352 tokens are unfrozen every second.

The purchase is made with stablecoins, so the Treasury is formed mainly from stable and LP tokens that are sold at a 20% discount.

The Guild Treasury is also formed by collecting commissions for the use of the project’s services. Commissions are charged in SOL, SVRG and project tokens.

### Use of the Treasury by projects

Startup projects can use the bond system and sell their tokens at a discount, with Svarog retaining 2% of all sales: 1% in stablecoins and 1% in project LP tokens. On top of that, an allocation for the DAO is added (a prerequisite) if the project is to be incubated by Svarog.

Internal projects, through the DAO voting procedure, can request funding in SOL and SVRG from the Treasury. After the vote and approval of the financing, the funds are transferred to a multisig wallet that is managed by the project team and 1 chosen external auditor. Projects receive money according to a payment schedule that is stipulated at the beginning of the project approval stage.

### Use of the Treasury by SVRG holders

Holders of SVRG tokens have the right to receive part of the commission collected by the Treasury. The frequency of payments is controlled by the DAO, through the voting system.

### Use of the Treasury by the Svarog team

The Svarog team has the right to receive a share of the Treasury (5%) for the development of the project. The frequency is agreed with the Guild.
