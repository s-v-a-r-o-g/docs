# Claiming

After the token is created, getting it distributed to project users and investors is a real challenge that requires specific knowledge and skill.&#x20;

The Svarog Claiming service enables newbie projects to distribute issued tokens to a large number of users so that the recipients themselves can claim their tokens. In other words, this tool comes in handy when there is a need to deliver your tokens to your community.

In order to initiate the Claiming process, the new Solana-based project has to send a list of addresses that it wants tokens distributed to, with a specified amount of tokens for each wallet.&#x20;

The startup then receives a link to the token Claiming page and sends that link to its community members who connect their wallets to the page. If their address is in the list, they can withdraw their tokens.  &#x20;

The Claiming service consists of two basic steps.

### Step 1.  Creating a Claims event&#x20;

1. On the Svarog website, a Solana project member must select the appropriate service section and specify: the token address, the number of tokens, a list of addresses (they can upload a CSV file)
2. Then, they click on the “Create” button.
3. Lastly, the member receives a unique link to the Handout.

### Step 2: Finalization&#x20;

1. The blockchain-based startup team sends the unique link to  its project’s end users.&#x20;
2. Each member of the project's community clicks on the link and…

* if their address (Phantom's browser wallet) is on the list, they can claim their tokens.
* if their address is not listed, then logically, they cannot get any tokens.

### Important information&#x20;

1. The blockchain startup team has to gather addresses from its audience in advance so that it understands who they should send the link to for the Claiming process.
2. The end user can only receive the tokens in their wallet after the Transfer Transaction is invoked.
3. It is the end user who pays for the transaction to transfer tokens to their wallet. Commission is paid in SVRG, SOL or the project’s token, whichever the user prefers. Commissions go to the Treasury.
4. Svarog allows startups to use its list of community addresses.
