No reliable, user-oriented platform can exist or function without a utility token. However, the process of issuing tokens is not as easy as it might seem at first and is especially problematic if the project’s creators are economists rather than developers.



Svarog presents a unique token creation service. Our premier service allows you to issue tokens of any standard for Guild members’ projects. Moreover, we give projects the opportunity to configure their tokens (freezes, token ownership, additional token issuing, etc.).\


At the moment, developers working in the Solana ecosystem can only issue their tokens through a console application (SPL-Token), but this method is not always convenient nor informative and can be difficult to accomplish. \


Using the Svarog UI, users simply fill out a form and click on "Create". It couldn't be simpler. With just a few clicks, the user receives the tokens in their wallet and will see them displayed in their personal account on the Svarog platform.&#x20;



We have simplified the first step. Furthermore, users are able to use these tokens for other Svarog services, which is quite handy. For example, users can stake them, add them to the liquidity pool, distribute them or they can use other features provided by the Svarog platform.\


The whole token creation process can be condensed into one step.&#x20;

### Just one step



1. First, the creator/project team specifies the total supply of tokens.
2. Then they input all the necessary information.
3. Next, the fee payment method should be determined. Generally, several coins are accepted, including the project’s token, SOL or SVRG.&#x20;
4. The creator/project team clicks on “Create Token”.
5. After that, the creator or development team confirms the transaction.
6. Finally, the creator receives the tokens in their wallet and all the associated information is sent to their personal account.

### Important information&#x20;

The fee for issuing tokens is paid in SVRG, SOL or the project’s tokens -  users may choose for themselves. All commissions go into the Guild Treasury.
