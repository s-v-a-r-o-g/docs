# Multisend



With the Multisend feature, startups can specify a fixed list of addresses and have the tokens sent straight to users' wallets.



This tool is crucial for drawing the attention of the community and investors to a startup. Apart from that, to help newbie projects operating on the Solana blockchain to substantially grow their audience, Svarog allows projects to use a list of its community addresses.\


Fundamentally, the whole Multisend service relies on two pretty simple steps, which our team will discuss below.&#x20;

### Step 1: Token Spreading

1. Firstly, the creator of the project specifies the address for controlled access, then inputs the list of recipients’ addresses and the number of tokens for each address.
2. Next, the method of payment needs to be selected.
3. There are several options to choose from: SOL, SVRGProject tokens
4. Lastly, the “Transfer” button must be clicked.&#x20;

### Step 2: Finalization of the Process

1. Once the transfer is processed, the tokens will appear in the user's wallet.&#x20;
2. Tokens can be observed and assessed in the personal cabinet on the Svarog platform.
3. From this moment on, the user is free to use the tokens as they please.&#x20;

### Important information&#x20;

1. The commision fee is paid by the initiator of the Multisend feature.
2. Svarog allows developers to use its community's address list.
3. Payment of commission is made in SVRG, SOL or the project’s token, it’s up to the user. Commissions go to the Treasury.
